Today I learned that one of my most beloved guides for ![Gopher](../../assets/gopher_head.png) ...is available in many other languages than English. I can even read it in my native language, Polish, and even though I'll probably still stick to English version, I greatly appreciate such an effort.

### By the way, I highly recommend reading this guide - it's _great_.
