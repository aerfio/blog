Since I've started working as software developer I've dreaded the code that tries to be some kind of "internal future proof framework". The worst thing, that can happen to Javascript and Golang codebases is some Java developer that has posters with Uncle Bob with SOLID text in the background, that just has to use some kind of AbstractBeanFactoryBuilderStrategyWhatever instaed of simple function.
